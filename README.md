# SoccerGamesAPI
A simple Android project by use of Android Studio
- The app bases on a list of soccer news articles from http://www.goal.com/en/feeds/news?fmt=rss
- The app will show the rating by use of five-stars rating bar
- The news titles will be listed in the list view
- After clicking the title of the news, the details of the news will be shown by fragment
- The news can be saved in the database

#### Here is a brief explaination of what I have done in this project.
